# 🧠 AI-Generated Fake Faces for Deepfake Detection

Exploring realism in synthetic human faces using state-of-the-art generative models.

---

## 🎯 Overview

This repository presents **AI-generated human faces** created for research on deepfake and synthetic image detection.

All images are produced using cutting-edge generative models such as **StyleGAN3** and **Diffusion-based GANs**, focusing on realism, diversity, and controllability.

These synthetic samples are used for:

- Benchmarking real-vs-fake detection models
- Studying visual artifacts in modern generators
- Evaluating generalization of multimodal detectors
